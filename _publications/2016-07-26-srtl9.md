*Abstract:* In this paper we report on a study of an innovative curriculum unit in which secondary school students learned about Big Data using real multivariate data with local and global contexts. The unit was designed to promote students’ covariational reasoning and engagement with big data concepts, while experiencing how statistical tools can be used to investigate trends and relationships to make decisions that can positively impact society. Inspired by notions of Classroom of the Future, the program used Interactive Orchestrated Learning Space (IOLS) and knowledge community approaches to create a multi-disciplinary learning environment. Students’ learning was investigated with mixed methods research tools. Findings from this study, including knowledge gains, are presented together with examples of students’ use of covariational reasoning to create arguments for change in a large city

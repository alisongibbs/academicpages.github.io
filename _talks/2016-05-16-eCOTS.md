With Bethany White.  In this breakout session,  we selected some of the key learning outcomes from technology-enhanced courses we have taught, including blended, flipped, and completely online courses and describe ways we have integrated different kinds of technology (including Shiny applets and R, audience response systems, interactive videos, online quizzes, and existing online learning objects) to help students achieve these outcomes.

A world of changing technology, accelerating complexity, and disruptive innovations presents a challenge for how to prepare our students for lifelong success.  In addition to an extensive base of knowledge and problem-solving strategies, our graduates need the ability to apply, adjust, and extend what they know in new environments and to new problems.  These adaptive experts will be flexible, innovative, and continual learners, able to function effectively as the nature of their jobs and the way they work change.   I will discuss the development of learners who are able to thrive in an unpredictable world, and pedagogical approaches to cultivate the development of adaptive expertise.  Iâ€™ll illustrate with some stories of learning experiences from an introductory data science course.

Our world of rapidly changing technology, disruptive innovations, and accelerating complexity presents a challenge for how to prepare our learners for lifelong success.  We need graduates with an extensive base of knowledge and problem-solving strategies who are also able to apply, adjust, and extend what they know  in new environments and to new problems.  These adaptive experts will be flexible, innovative, and continual learners, able to function effectively as the nature of their jobs and the way they work change.  This talk addresses educational approaches to cultivate the development of adaptive expertise, illustrated with some examples of learning experiences from an introductory data science course.

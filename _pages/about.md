I am a Professor, Teaching Stream in the [Department of Statistical Sciences](http://utstat.toronto.edu) and Director of the [Centre for Teaching Support and Innovation](https://teaching.utoronto.ca) at the [University of Toronto](https://www.utoronto.ca).

I am interested in the teaching and learning of Statistics and Data Science at all levels, from primary through graduate school.  I am engaged in various projects related to data science in schools, online learning, inverted classrooms, statistics curriculum development, achieving adaptive expertise, and the development of professional identity. 

### Some Recent Projects:

- [International Data Science in Schools Project](http://www.idssp.org)
- [Census at School Canada](http://censusatschool.ca)
- [Introduction to Statistical Ideas and Methods](http://stats.onlinelearning.utoronto.ca)
